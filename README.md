# Hello World! 

My name is Courtney!

Welcome to Griddy Data! Here you'll find a collection of data analysis projects that I have been working on. I recently graduated with a degree in economics and international affairs, but I wanted to continue building my skill set. I believe data can help us make better decisions and build a better world.

A few things about me:
- I love ice cream
- I listen to podcasts daily
- I take my nalgene water bottle everywhere 
- I am really into politics
- I try to live minimally
